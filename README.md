# TopJobPosting
**Objective and Purpose**  
Job postings of the public hospital network of the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, follow a uniform structure.  
Job boards that reproduce these job postings on their own platforms or third-party platforms shall use the information of this project "TopJobPosting" to reproduce their ads.

**Target Audience**  
The content of these pages is aimed at implementation managers. Knowledge of HTTP, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS is expected.

# Job Advertisement
The template files for the job advertisement postings can be found in the [/docs](docs) directory. They represent the expected result.
The previews contain sample job advertisements. Note that the external links in examples may not work due to their example nature.

- Example ad in [Layout SV1](https://svsg-jobs.github.io/TopJobPosting/LayoutSV1.html)  
- Example ad in [Layout SV4](https://svsg-jobs.github.io/TopJobPosting/LayoutSV4.html)

# Job Listing
Template files for the job listing are currently under development and will be published here when available.  

# Feed and Contact
Partners will be provided with the job advertisement data as a feed.
